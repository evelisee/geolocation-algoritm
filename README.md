# Webpack Geolocation with SASS(SCSS), HTML modules, Babel

Project developed for Nike's geolocation solution with vanilla javascript.

- The responsive is not faithful.
- The font used was Roboto instead of the Helvetica family because it contains paid copyright.
- Consumed a list of stores with addresses in a fixed mock code. The locations are real from nike stores (taken from the official website).
- If you do not have a coordinate in mind, use: `-23.5421331,-46.6971003`
